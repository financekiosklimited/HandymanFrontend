## Plan Check Passed ✓

**Phase:** 1
**Plans checked:** 1
**Status:** PASSED

No blocking issues found.

**Warnings:**
- None.

**Breakdown by Dimension:**
- **D1. Requirement Coverage:** The goal of replicating the guest layout is directly addressed by the single task.
- **D2. Task Completeness:** The task defines `files`, `action`, `verify`, and `done` criteria. The `action` explicitly restricts adding new components, which aligns with non-goals.
- **D3. Dependency Correctness:** Only wave 1 is planned. No cyclical dependencies exist.
- **D4. Key Links Planned:** Only modifying an existing file; no new artifacts are being created waiting to be hooked up.
- **D5. Scope Sanity:** Total 1 file, 1 task. Easily fits context budget.
- **D6. Verification Derivation:** The three must-haves explicitly enforce the goal of visual consistency, without adding components, and while preserving business logic/fetching.
