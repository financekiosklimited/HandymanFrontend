# Phase 1.1 Summary: Apply Guest Homepage Design to Homeowner Homepage

## Objective
Update the homeowner homepage to match the visual design and layout of the guest homepage. Maintain visual consistency across different user roles while preserving role-specific functionality.

## Changes Made
- Modified `packages/app/features/homeowner/home/screen.tsx`.
- Refactored `View` root and standard `ScrollView` into `GradientBackground` and `AnimatedScrollView`.
- Substituted static `YStack` elements with `AnimatedYStack` applying entry animations for Welcome, Call to Action, and Filter sections.
- Embedded a "Minimalist CTA" panel matching the guest visual design seamlessly without losing link hooks to job addition routing.
- Validated all tag structures inside ` screen.tsx`, ensuring formatting conformity with Biome and logic with TypeScript compiler.

## Verifications Complete
- Visual Design Transfer: Render hierarchy aligned with guest design properties.
- Functionality Preservation: Native hooks (`useProfile`, `useHomeownerJobs`, `useNearbyHandymen`, `useCities`) remained untouched.
- Syntax and Validation: `npx biome check` explicitly resolves formatting and nesting cleanly. `npx tsc --noEmit` validates type retention.

## Success Criteria
All constraints, including avoiding adding any new functional components to `screen.tsx`, were strictly upheld. The execution goal for Phase 1 is verified and complete.
